My name is Jan-Philip Steinmann and I am head of the research unit "Aetiology of Deviance" at the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony ({{% staticref "https://en.kfn.de/" "newtab" %}}KFN{{% /staticref %}}) and affiliated postdoctoral researcher at the Research Institute Social Cohesion ({{% staticref "https://fgz-risc.de/" "newtab" %}}RISC{{% /staticref %}}) at the University of Bremen, Germany. I consider myself a sociologist, on the edge of cultural sociology and social structure analysis. My research interests, in the broadest sense, relate to causes and consequences of (decreasing or increasing) social cohesion. Thereby, I mainly focus on social inequalities, migration processes and immigrants’ integration, right-wing populism, and deviant behavior. Across all these topics, I investigate paradoxical effects of religion. Although I am mostly using quantitative empirical methods, I am also conducting mixed methods research.

I am the principal investigator of the project "The Role of Religiosity in Delinquency among Christian and Muslim Youths" ({{% staticref "https://en.kfn.de/research-projects/dfg-religion-delinquency/" "newtab" %}}ReliDeli{{% /staticref %}}), which addresses the classic criminological question of how religiosity and delinquent behavior are related. The project is funded by the German Research Foundation ({{% staticref "https://www.dfg.de/en" "newtab" %}}DFG{{% /staticref %}}).

I hold a doctoral degree from the University of Goettingen ({{% staticref "https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html" "newtab" %}}UGÖ{{% /staticref %}}), Germany. I have been visiting student/researcher at Utrecht University ({{% staticref "https://www.uu.nl/en" "newtab" %}}UU{{% /staticref %}}) and the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute ({{% staticref "https://nidi.nl/en/" "newtab" %}}NIDI{{% /staticref %}}) in The Hague.

My work has been published in several journals, including leading outlets in general sociology (Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie, Socius) and criminology (Criminal Justice and Behavior, European Journal of Criminology), as well as prominent journals in migration research (International Migration Review, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies).
