My name is Jan-Philip Steinmann, I am a research assistant at the University of Goettingen, Germany, where I am currently working on my PhD thesis. Although, I am a sociologist, I make use of interdisciplinary ideas from various fields such as social psychology, educational research, demography or statistics. My research focus mainly relates to migration processes and immigrants’ integration. Particularly, I have worked on various topics so far, including anti-immigrant attitudes, remigration intentions, ethnic boundary-making, perceived discrimination, inter-ethnic contact, and immigrants’ labour market integration, mainly using quantitative empirical methods.

My work appeared in journals such as Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, Migration Studies, and International Journal of Conflict and Violence.
