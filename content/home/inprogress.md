  description = "The delinquency-reducing function of religiosity is a well-established pattern in the criminological literature. We challenge previous findings by testing a curvilinear alternative, hypothesizing that religiosity and delinquency are negatively related only up to a moderate level of religiosity, after which the relationship reverses. Using data from more than 46,000 adolescents in Germany collected across six surveys between 2013 and 2024, we examine violent offenses and substance use. Our results reveal a consistent curvilinear relationship between religiosity and delinquency. The link between religiosity and violent offenses reverses, with highly religious adolescents reporting the highest levels of violent offending. For substance use, religiosity generally remains protective, but this effect gradually weakens as religiosity increases. We discuss two complementary explanations for the curvilinear relationship between religiosity and delinquency: the religious-ideology perspective and the loss-of-privileges perspectives."

  description = "This study examines where and how religious boundaries are drawn and maintained by exploring the relationship between the visible display of religious markers and perceived religious discrimination among Christian and Muslim adolescents in Germany. It asks whether religious visibility heightens perceptions of religious discrimination, and how this varies by religious affiliation, gender, and education. Data come from a 2024 survey of ninth graders in Germany. Empirical findings indicate that perceptions of religious discrimination increase with greater religious visibility. However, this effect is not uniform across subgroups. The strongest—though statistically somewhat uncertain—effects are observed among female and more educated Muslims. Drawing on Christian and Muslim adolescents in Germany, results reveal that religious boundaries exist, but the main tension is not between religiosity and secularity. This underscores prior research showing that reinforcing processes sustain religious boundaries—particularly between Christianity and secularity, on the one hand, and Islam, on the other."

  description = "Der Artikel untersucht den Wandel des religiösen cleavage und fragt, ob Religion weiterhin das Wahlverhalten in Deutschland prägt und ob sich die Konfliktlinie nach dem Übergang von konfessionell zu religiös-säkular erneut verschoben hat. Vor dem Hintergrund einer postulierten Konfliktlinie des Religionsanspruchs wird argumentiert, dass ein exklusiver gegenüber einem inklusiven Religionsanspruch unter Christ:innen die Wahrscheinlichkeit erhöht, Pfade der Radikalisierung (Wahl der AfD), der Traditionalisierung (CDU/CSU) oder des Rückzugs (Nicht-Wahl) einzuschlagen. Zudem werden rechtspopulistische Positionen und wahrgenommene religiöse Benachteiligung als vermittelnde Faktoren für diese Pfade vorgeschlagen. Die Befunde legen Ansätze einer erneuten Transformation des religiösen cleavage in Deutschland nahe. Der Religionsanspruch von Christ:innen ist mitentscheidend für ihr Wahlverhalten, vermittelt über rechtspopulistische Positionen und wahrgenommene religiöse Benachteiligung."

  url = ""
  certificate_url = ""
  date_start = "2025-05-15"
  date_end = ""
  description = "This article examines gender-role values among Christian and Muslim adolescents with varying levels of religiosity. It asks whether religious fundamentalism, rather than religious affiliation or religiosity alone, is the key factor driving such values. School survey data from seventh graders in Germany (N = 3,712) show that Muslim adolescents are more likely to support patriarchal gender-role values than their Christian counterparts, although differences are moderate in size. Religious fundamentalism mediates the relationship between religious affiliation and patriarchal gender-role values, and accounts for a substantial share of the association between religiosity and gender-role values among Christians. Overall, the findings highlight religious fundamentalism as the central correlate of patriarchal gender-role values and challenges stereotypes that portray Islam as inherently linked to patriarchy."
