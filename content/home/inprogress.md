  description = "In this article, we contribute to the question on how cross-national differences in misperceptions of the foreign-born population size come about by adding national discourses on immigration to the explanation. We provide theoretical reasoning why such discourses articulated by politics and media should have an effect on individual (mis)perceptions. Thereby, we differentiate between salience and valence of national discourses and consider the interplay between such discourses and individuals’ actual exposure to political and media debates. Based on 2014 European Social Survey (ESS) data, multilevel analyses are conducted. Empirical findings indicate that mere salience of national discourses on immigration is not decisive when explaining (mis)perceptions of the foreign-born population size. Instead, overestimating the number of foreign-born people is less likely to occur when discourse by politicians is more inclusive towards immigrants. However, such discourses may also lead to more pronounced underestimation. Effects of immigration-related national discourse on individual misperceptions are not conditional on people’s exposure to politics and media. We conclude that politicians may prevent Europeans’ overestimation of the foreign-born population size by addressing immigration in a positive way."
