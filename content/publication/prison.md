abstract: This article addresses the perceived religious discrimination and lack of religious opportunity structure among imprisoned young Muslims and how these religion-related prison experiences affect their out-group hostility. Furthermore, it examines whether the link between these experiences and out-group hostility depends on religiosity. Building on general strain theory, religion-related prison experiences are conceptualized as events potentially leading to out-group hostility. The coping literature is used to identify different dimensions of religiosity that can either strengthen or weaken the relationship of interest. Data from German youth prisons were analyzed. Qualitative findings (N = 22) indicate imprisoned Muslims experience disadvantages in practicing their religion but feel grateful rather than discriminated against. Quantitative results (N = 311) show perceived religious discrimination is positively linked to out-group hostility, while lack of religious opportunity structure is not. Religiosity did not moderate the association between perceived religious discrimination and out-group hostility.
